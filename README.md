# √∞≈∏≈í≈í EGOS - Ethical Governance Operating System

> "Building the infrastructure for transparent, ethical AI governance with blockchain-backed validation"

![License: MIT](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT)
![Status: Active](https://github.com/enioxt/EGOS)
!Ethical Framework: ETHIK
![GitHub Stars](https://github.com/enioxt/EGOS)

## √∞≈∏‚Äù¬ç What is EGOS?

**EGOS** is an integrated ecosystem for ethical AI governance that combines:

- **√∞≈∏¬ß¬† Ethics as a Service (EaaS)**: API-driven ethical evaluations through ATRiAN
- **√¢‚Ä∫‚Äú√Ø¬∏¬è Decentralized Validation**: Blockchain-backed ethical verification via DEV
- **√∞≈∏‚Ä∫¬†√Ø¬∏¬è Modular Components**: Purpose-built subsystems working in concert
- **√∞≈∏‚Äú≈† Transparency Tools**: Visual dashboards for oversight and accountability

EGOS stands apart from other AI ethics platforms by implementing a practical, actionable governance system rather than just theoretical guidelines.

> **Coming Soon ‚Äì EGOS Dashboard MVP**  
> A public, Streamlit-powered dashboard that showcases real-time ethical metrics, prompt governance and system health. Follow the Dashboard MVP Plan and the Roadmap section for progress.

## √∞≈∏‚Äù‚Äû Why Choose EGOS?

Unlike theoretical ethics frameworks or general-purpose AI platforms, EGOS provides:

- **Practical Implementation**: Ready-to-use tools and APIs for embedding ethics in AI systems
- **Decentralized Trust**: Not reliant on a single authority for ethical validation
- **Blockchain Transparency**: Every ethical evaluation is transparent and immutable
- **Modular Integration**: Components can be adopted individually based on your needs
- **Living Documentation**: Continuously evolving best practices and standards

## Stable vs Dev workflow

EGOS now follows a **single-tree, dual-maturity** layout:

| Location | Purpose | Branch |
|----------|---------|--------|
| `subsystems/<module>/src` | üì¶ **Stable** production-ready code mounted by `docker-compose.yml` | `main` |
| `subsystems/<module>/dev` | üß™ Experimental / WIP code hot-reloaded by `docker-compose.dev.yml` | feature branches |

Promotion path:
1. Develop in `dev/` on a feature branch.
2. Open PR ‚Üí CI runs Ruff, Pytest (coverage ‚â• 80 %), ATRiAN ethics scan.
3. Use `scripts/git_promote.ps1` to move vetted files to `src/` within the PR.
4. Merge into `main` ‚Äî prod containers rebuild automatically.

Guard rails:
* Pre-commit hook prevents direct edits to `src/` outside `main`.
* CI blocks merges on lint/test/coverage failures.

## √∞≈∏‚Äô¬∞ Blockchain Integration

EGOS integrates with the BASE blockchain through the $ETHIK token:

* **BASE**: <a href="https://gmgn.ai/base/token/0x633b346b85c4877ace4d47f7aa72c2a092136cb5" target="_blank">`0x633b346b85c4877ace4d47f7aa72c2a092136cb5`</a>

## √∞≈∏‚Äú≈ì KOIOS: Prompt Design & Validation Subsystem

The **KOIOS subsystem** is central to EGOS's commitment to high-quality, consistent, and reusable AI prompts. It provides a comprehensive framework for Prompt Design Documents (PDDs), ensuring that all prompts used within the EGOS ecosystem are well-defined, validated, and managed.

**Key Capabilities of KOIOS:**

*   **Hierarchical PDD Schema (`pdd_schema.py`):**
    *   A robust Pydantic-based schema defines the structure for PDDs, ensuring all necessary metadata and prompt components are present.
    *   Supports a base schema for common fields and specialized schemas (e.g., `SpecializedHandlerPddSchema`) for advanced prompt types, selected via a `pdd_type` field in the PDD YAML.
    *   Enforces strict validation (`extra = 'forbid'`) to maintain schema integrity.
*   **Automated Validation (`validate_pdd.py`):**
    *   A dedicated script validates PDD YAML files against the defined schemas, providing clear success/failure feedback and detailed error reporting. This ensures PDDs are syntactically correct and complete before use.
*   **Standardized Prompt Engineering:**
    *   Promotes a consistent approach to designing and documenting prompts, enhancing clarity, reusability, and maintainability.
    *   Facilitates the creation of complex prompts by providing a structured template.
*   **Foundation for Advanced AI Operations:**
    *   Validated PDDs serve as reliable inputs for automated prompt execution frameworks, AI model interactions, and integration with other EGOS subsystems like ATRiAN (for ethical reviews) and Mycelium (for knowledge graphing).
*   **Workflow Integration:**
    *   PDD validation is integrated into core EGOS workflows, such as the `/distill_and_vault_prompt` process, ensuring prompts are associated with valid PDDs before being stored in the PromptVault.

The KOIOS subsystem, through its PDD standard and validation tools, underpins the quality and reliability of all prompt-driven operations within EGOS, aligning with the MQP principles of clarity, context, and precision in AI interactions. Refer to the **KOIOS Prompt Design Document (PDD) Standard** for detailed specifications.


* **Distillation & Vaulting:** Prompts are distilled from effective LLM interactions via the `/distill_and_vault_prompt` workflow and automatically stored in JSON format.
* **Versioning & Searchability:** Each entry is timestamped, schema-validated, and searchable‚Äîbuilding a living library of best-practice prompts.
* **Reverse Prompt Engineering:** Facilitates analysis and refinement of master prompts to continuously improve AI output quality.

Current vaulted prompts include:

* `2025-06-09_103100_explicacao_python_iniciante.json`
* `ultimate_multidisciplinary_strategic_analysis_v3.json`

Refer to PromptVault when designing new kernels or tasks to avoid duplicating work and ensure consistency across the ecosystem.

## üîó AutoCrossRef: Your Project's Living Knowledge Graph

The **AutoCrossRef** system is a powerful internal tool that acts as the connective tissue for the entire EGOS project. It automatically scans every file, understands its location, and injects a self-referencing link. This simple action is the foundation for a powerful, interconnected knowledge management system.

### How It Works & Technologies Used

-   **Core Technology**: A robust Python script (`subsystems/AutoCrossRef/src/ref_injector.py`) handles all the logic. It's built to be lightweight and has no external dependencies beyond standard Python libraries.
-   **Process**:
    1.  A master script (`scripts/regen_references.py`) is run.
    2.  It traverses all specified project directories (like `docs/` and `subsystems/`).
    3.  For each file, it creates a secure, timestamped backup.
    4.  It intelligently finds the correct insertion point (e.g., after shebangs/encoding lines in Python files).
    5.  It injects a commented-out `@references` block containing the file's own path.
-   **CI/CD Integration**: The system is backed by a GitHub Actions workflow (`.github/workflows/autocrossref_ci.yml`) that runs comprehensive unit and integration tests on every change, guaranteeing its stability.

### Practical Benefits & Real-World Utility

-   **Instant Context & Impact Analysis**: By creating a machine-readable map of the project, we can instantly answer questions like, "If I change this file, what other parts of the system might be affected?" This dramatically reduces development risks.
-   **Accelerated Onboarding**: New developers can understand the relationships between different parts of the code and documentation much faster, navigating the project as if it were a wiki.
-   **Living Documentation**: It prevents documentation from becoming stale and isolated. Every document is an active node in the project's knowledge graph.
-   **Foundation for Advanced Tooling**: This reference system is the prerequisite for future tools, such as automated diagram generation, dependency analysis dashboards, and advanced semantic code search.

The AutoCrossRef system transforms a static collection of files into a dynamic, interconnected, and intelligent knowledge base, embodying the EGOS principle of systemic coherence. The newly implemented hierarchical reference standard enforcement ensures consistent cross-referencing across all project files, with support for different operational modes (diagnose, fix-core, full) and detailed compliance reporting.
