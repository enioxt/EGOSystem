# EGOS Public Documentation

This directory hosts all markdown, images and diagrams that are safe for public release.  
Any file placed here (or sub-folders) **will be synchronised** to the public repository `EGOSystem` by the `publish_public_docs.ps1` script.  

• **Do not** add executable code, secrets, or private links.  
• Include a header banner `DRAFT / NOT YET STANDARDISED` for work-in-progress docs.
