# Daily Update — 2025-07-08 — Documentation Synchronization

## Highlights

- **Documentation Synchronization Complete**
  - Unified all daily reports into a single `daily-reports/` directory at the repository root in both private and public repositories
  - Removed redundant directories (`docs/daily_updates/`, `docs/daily_reports/`, `docs-public/`)
  - Added clear README.md files to both repositories explaining the purpose and integration of daily reports
  - Updated all scripts to reference the new `daily-reports/` path

- **Public Repository Security**
  - Added a restrictive pre-commit hook to prevent accidental commits of private code
  - Created a whitelist system that only allows specific paths (`docs/`, `daily-reports/`, etc.)
  - Updated `.gitignore` to reflect the new directory structure

- **Script Updates**
  - Updated manual posting scripts (`manual_daily_post.sh`, `sync_daily_report.sh`)
  - Updated GitHub Actions workflow (`x_daily_post.yml`)
  - Updated Python utilities (`generate_daily_summary.py`, `get_telegram_message.py`, `manual_post_daily.sh`)
  - Updated audit and metrics scripts (`file_audit.py`, `xref_health.py`)

- **Public Documentation Content**
  - Ensured all high-level, non-technical documentation is available in the public repo
  - Updated public README.md to be repository-agnostic and non-technical
  - Emphasized the mycelial interconnectedness of the EGOS ecosystem in documentation
