# Daily Update — 2025-07-08

## Highlights

### Documentation & Governance
- Completed migration of all daily reports into a single `daily-reports/` directory across private and public repositories, ensuring consistent structure and discoverability.
- Added explanatory `README.md` in each `daily-reports/` folder to clarify purpose and integration with the wider EGOS ecosystem.
- Hardened the public repository with a whitelist-based pre-commit hook to prevent accidental exposure of private code and assets.

### Testing & CI
- Activated the full **ATRiAN** test suite, integrating ethical-policy validation into our standard CI gate.
- Added a *pre-deploy check* workflow that catches import/dependency issues before Vercel/Render builds.
- Enabled **SonarQube Clean-as-You-Code** on the website for continuous code-quality feedback.

### Workflows & Automation
- Unified documentation-sync and cross-reference maintenance workflows for simpler daily automation.
- Removed the deprecated `API=true` flag from `/activate_egos`, reflecting our Render-first deployment strategy.

### Community & Navigation
- Added EKLP link to website navigation and fixed footer imports.
- Updated Contributor Guide with beta programme and testing guidance.

> **Why it matters** – These changes improve transparency, security, and build reliability while reinforcing our *mycelial* principle of interconnectedness.
